# Weather-app
This HTML and JavaScript project creates a simple weather app. Users can enter a city name in the search input, click the search button, and the app fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. The weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, is displayed along with an icon representing the current weather condition. In case of an invalid city name, an error message is shown. The app dynamically updates the weather icon based on the weather conditions (cloudy, clear, rain, drizzle, mist). The interface is designed with a clean layout using HTML and styled with CSS. The project employs asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to handle API requests and enhances the user experience with dynamic content updates. The responsive design ensures compatibility across various devices.
